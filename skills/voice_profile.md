## Transition Story

"After 10 years in education, I realized that the skills I developed—analyzing student data to improve outcomes, managing multiple complex projects simultaneously, and collaborating with diverse stakeholders—are exactly what businesses need. My math background gives me the quantitative foundation, and my teaching experience taught me how to communicate complex ideas clearly. I'm not leaving education behind; I'm applying everything I learned to help organizations make better decisions."
